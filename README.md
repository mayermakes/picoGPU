# picoGPU
RPi pico used as crude Graphics adapter (only low res text mode)

Firmware for RP2040/pico
-> can receive commands via I2C and SERIAL
i2c allows for more screen control ( only works between MCUs for unknown reason)
Serial just prints what it receives to screen and changes to random color for each new page.
Serial works on MCu and SBC/PC

Driver published as python script and compiled binary for Linux.
For those asking for a windows exe..... pffffff...lol

Seriously, pray that I never get the urge to publish special exe files. 
Meanwhile you can use a windows machine to compile the python script into an exe.
